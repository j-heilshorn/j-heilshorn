Well. After winning so much at Dominion I finally turn my attention to more sophisticated challenges. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Markdown is a markup language with a syntax closer to plain text.
